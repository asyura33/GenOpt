<H2><a name="inst">Installation</a></H2>
<P>
To run GenOpt, you need to install a Java interpreter, which may be obtained from
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/index.html" TARGET=new>Sun Microsystems</A>.
Sun Microsystems has also Java for Microsoft Windows.<P>
Please refer to the GenOpt manual for how to install and run GenOpt.
The manual can be downloaded from 
<A HREF="http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO" TARGET=new>http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO</A>.
</P>

<H2><a name="dire">Directories</a></H2>
<!-- ========================================================== -->
<H3>genopt</H3>
<P>
The <CODE>genopt</CODE> directory contains the binary code of GenOpt.
The directory <CODE>genopt/algorithm</CODE> contains also the source code 
of the optimization algorithms. 
You do not have to compile these files. 
They are only of interest if you want to implement your own optimization algorithms.
</P>
<!-- ========================================================== -->
<H3>jdoc</H3>
<P>
This directory contains the code <A HREF="./jdoc/index.html">documentation</A> 
of the package <CODE>genopt.algorithm</CODE>. 
Please refer to it if you implement own optimization algorithms.
</P>
<!-- ========================================================== -->
<H3>example</H3>
<P>
There are examples that use EnergyPlus to evaluate the cost function,
and examples that minimizes a quadratic cost function.
For illustrating the use of GenOpt, the directory <code>example/quad</code>
contains several examples that either minimize a simple quadratic cost function
or use the quadratic function to do parametric runs.
These examples are recommended as a starting point to learn how GenOpt works.

<H2><a name="file">Files</a></H2>
<!-- ========================================================== -->

<H3>cfg/*.cfg</H3>
<P>
The cfg files show how to configure different simulation programs on 
various operating systems.
</P><P>
Please see the notes in the files for which program and operating system they were written.
</P>
<!-- ========================================================== -->
<H3>*.class</H3>
<P>
The class files that contain the binary code. 
They will be loaded during the execution of GenOpt.
</P>
<!-- ========================================================== -->
<H3>*.java</H3>
<P>
The java files contain the source code.
</P>

<!-- ========================================================== -->
<H2><a name="run">Running GenOpt</a></H2>
<!-- ========================================================== -->
To run an example, make sure you set the environment variables
as described in the GenOpt manual that can be downloaded
from the web.
</P><P>
Alternatively, on Mac OS X or Linux you can open a shell, go to this directory
and type <pre>  source setenv.sh</pre> to set the environment variables. This can 
also be done on Windows if you have <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> installed.
</P>
<P>
To start GenOpt's graphical user interface, double-click the file
<code>genopt.jar</code>.
To start GenOpt from a command line, open a shell (on Mac OS X or Linux) or a MS-DOS window
(on Windows), and type either<PRE>  java genopt.WinGenOpt</PRE>
or <PRE>  java genopt.GenOpt</PRE> The second version will start GenOpt without the graphical user
interface.
</P><p>
For example, to run the minimization of the quadratic function
using the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm, you can type on Linux and Mac OS X<PRE>
  cd example/quad/GPSHookeJeeves
  java genopt.WinGenOpt</PRE>
and on Windows 
<PRE>
  cd example\quad\GPSHookeJeeves
  java genopt.WinGenOpt optXXX.ini</PRE>
where <CODE>XXX</CODE> is the name of your operating system.
</p><p>
Alternatively, you can run GenOpt without the graphical user interface by typing<P>
<PRE>  java genopt.GenOpt optXXX.ini</PRE><P>
</P><P>
For further information and how to use your simulation software
to evaluate the cost function, please read the manual.</P>
