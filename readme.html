<H1>GenOpt&reg; Release Note</H1>
<P>
This file gives short instructions for installing and running GenOpt.
For more details, please consult the GenOpt manual which can be downloaded from 
<A HREF="http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO" TARGET=new>http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO</A>.

<!-- ========================================================== -->
<H3>Running GenOpt from the file explorer</H3>
<!-- ========================================================== -->
<p>
To run GenOpt from the file explorer,
double-click on the file <code>genopt.jar</code>.
This will start the graphical user interface. 
From the graphical user interface, select <code>File</code>, 
<code>Start...</code> and select a GenOpt initialization file.
<!-- ========================================================== -->
<H3>Running GenOpt from the command line</H3>
<p>
GenOpt can also be run as a console application, either with or without the
graphical user interface.
To run GenOpt as a console application with graphical user interface, 
open a shell, go to this directory and type
<PRE>  java -jar genopt.jar [initializationFile]</PRE>
where <code>[initializationFile]</code> is an optional argument that can be
replaced with the GenOpt initialization file (see example below).
To start GenOpt without the graphical user interface, type
<PRE>  java -classpath genopt.jar genopt.GenOpt [initializationFile]</PRE> 
</P><p>
For example, to run the example file provided with GenOpt that minimizes a quadratic function using the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm, 
type on Mac OSX<PRE>
  java -jar genopt.jar example/quad/GPSHookeJeeves/optMacOSX.ini</PRE>
on Linux<PRE>
  java -jar genopt.jar example/quad/GPSHookeJeeves/optLinux.ini</PRE>
and on Windows 
<PRE>
  java -jar genopt.jar example\quad\GPSHookeJeeves\optWinXP.ini</PRE>
</p><p>
For further information and how to use your simulation software
to evaluate the cost function, please read the manual.</P>

<H3>example</H3>
<P>
This directory contains examples that use EnergyPlus, IDA, Java or Dymola to evaluate the cost function.
To illustrate the use of GenOpt, the directory <code>example/quad</code>
contains several examples that either minimize a simple quadratic cost function
or use the quadratic function to do parametric runs.
These examples are recommended as a starting point to learn how GenOpt works.
To learn how inequality constraints on the cost function can be implemented, see
<code>example/quad/constraint</code>.
</p>
<H3>cfg</H3>
<P>
This directory contains files that show how to configure different simulation 
programs on various operating systems. 
The files in this directory contain comments that explain for which program and 
operating system they were written.
</P>
<H3>src</H3>
<P>
The <CODE>src</CODE> directory contains the source code of GenOpt.
The source code of the optimization algorithms
can be found in the directory <CODE>src/genopt/algorithm</CODE>.
You do not have to compile these files. They are only of interest if you want to implement your own optimization algorithms.
</P>
<!-- ========================================================== -->
<H3>documentation</H3>
<P>
This directory contains the 
<A HREF="./documentation/manual.pdf">manual</A> and the
<A HREF="./documentation/jdoc/index.html">code documentation</A>.
The code documentation is only needed by developers.
</P>
