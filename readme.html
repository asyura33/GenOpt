<H1>GenOpt&reg; Release Note</H1>
<P>
This file gives short instructions for installing and running GenOpt.
For more details, please consult the GenOpt manual which can be downloaded from 
<A HREF="http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO" TARGET=new>http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/GO</A>.

<H2><a name="inst">Installation</a></H2>
<P>
To run GenOpt, you need to install a Java interpreter, which may be obtained from
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/index.html" TARGET=new>Sun Microsystems</A>.
Sun Microsystems has also Java for Microsoft Windows.

<!-- ========================================================== -->
<H3>Running GenOpt from the file explorer</H3>
<!-- ========================================================== -->
<p>
The easiest way to run GenOpt is to double-click on the file <code>genopt.jar</code>.
This will start the graphical user interface.
<!-- ========================================================== -->
<H3>Running GenOpt from the command line</H3>
<p>
GenOpt can also be run as a console application, either with or without the
graphical user interface.
To run GenOpt as a console application with graphical user interface, 
open a shell, go to this directory and type
<PRE>  java -jar genopt.jar [initializatonFile]</PRE>
where <code>[initializatonFile]</code> is an optional argument that can be
replaced with the initialization file (see example below).
To start GenOpt without the graphical user interface, type
<PRE>  java -classpath genopt.jar genopt.GenOpt [initializatonFile]</PRE> 
</P><p>
For example, to run the minimization of the quadratic function that is provided
with the example files using the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm, 
you can type on Linux and Mac OS X<PRE>
  java -jar genopt.jar example/quad/GPSHookeJeeves/optLinux.ini</PRE>
and on Windows 
<PRE>
  java -jar genopt.jar example\quad\GPSHookeJeeves\optWinXP.ini</PRE>
</p><p>
For further information and how to use your simulation software
to evaluate the cost function, please read the manual.</P>

<P>
This directory contains files that show how to configure different simulation 
programs on various operating systems. 
The files in this directory contain comments that explain for which program and 
operating system they were written.
</P>
<P>
This directory contains examples that use EnergyPlus to evaluate the cost function,
and examples that minimizes a quadratic cost function.
For illustrating the use of GenOpt, the directory <code>example/quad</code>
contains several examples that either minimize a simple quadratic cost function
or use the quadratic function to do parametric runs.
These examples are recommended as a starting point to learn how GenOpt works.

<P>
The <CODE>genopt</CODE> directory contains the source and binary code of GenOpt.
The source code of the optimization algorithms
can be found in the directory <CODE>genopt/algorithm</CODE>.
You do not have to compile these files. They are only of interest if you want to implement your own optimization algorithms.

<H3>jdoc</H3>
<P>
This directory contains the code <A HREF="./jdoc/index.html">documentation</A> 
of the package <CODE>genopt.algorithm</CODE>. 
Please refer to it if you implement your own optimization algorithms.
